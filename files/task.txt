I think you forgot to enable Jpa Transaction or to associate Spring Data with the transaction manager:

Ex enable transaction management:

@EnableTransactionManagement(mode = AdviceMode.ASPECTJ)
Ex associate transaction manager with Jpa Repositories:

@EnableJpaRepositories(transactionManagerRef="transactionManager",
    entityManagerFactoryRef="entityManagerFactory",
    value="com.repositories.pkg.location" )
